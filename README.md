  üö∞ Capstone A-10 (Frontend) 
</h1>

## ‚ùì About 
In this capstone project held by DTETI FT UGM, we, as A-10 team, designed a prototype system to monitor water quality and detect leaks in air distribution pipes with residual vector and sensitivity matrix method. In this system, we also added control mechanism to control the pressure pump with PID controller to achieve desired pressure and stop further waste due to leakage.

## üîô Main Repositories
[Capstone-A10-DTETI-2023 (Github Orgs)](https://github.com/Capstone-A10-DTETI-2023)

## ‚å® Commit Naming Convention
- `feat` is for adding a new feature
- `fix` is for fixing a bug
- `refactor` is for changing code for peformance or convenience purpose (e.g. readibility)
- `chore` is for everything else (writing documentation, formatting, adding tests, cleaning useless code etc.).  
<br/>After the category, there should be a ":" announcing the commit description. You could use (scope) to specify which scope are you working to.

### Example
- `feat: add post controller` <br/>
- `chore: update readme` <br/>
- `fix(auth): fix signin input now showing`
